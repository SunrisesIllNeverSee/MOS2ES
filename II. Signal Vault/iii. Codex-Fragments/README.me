# Codex Fragments â€“ Living Thought

The **Codex Fragments** folder houses the evolving intellectual and narrative layer of MOÂ§ESâ„¢ â€” essays, reflections, comparative analyses, or narrative explorations produced through the system.
These fragments function as **living drafts**, continuously refined until elevated to artifact status.

This space embodies the creative pulse of the protocol: where resonance becomes expression.
