# Codex Fragments – Living Thought

The **Codex Fragments** folder houses the evolving intellectual and narrative layer of MO§ES™ — essays, reflections, comparative analyses, or narrative explorations produced through the system.
These fragments function as **living drafts**, continuously refined until elevated to artifact status.

This space embodies the creative pulse of the protocol: where resonance becomes expression.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MOS²ES, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
