# Artifacts â€“ Compression Proofs

The **Artifacts** folder contains finalized or semi-finalized works derived from the MOÂ§ESâ„¢ protocol â€” including documents, graphics, or PPA filings.
Each artifact serves as a **sealed proof of compression**, cryptographically timestamped and bound to its lineage.

Artifacts are the **operational outputs** of the system: the bridge between private signal and public verification.
