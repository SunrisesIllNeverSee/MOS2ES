# Seeds â€“ Genesis Layer

The **Seeds** folder captures the earliest developmental materials of MOÂ§ESâ„¢ â€” raw thoughts, prototype drafts, design notes, and internal reflections.
Every idea begins here before undergoing compression and formalization.

Each seed represents an **origin signal**, preserved for continuity and future validation within the Signal Vault.
