### üß± SIGSYSTEM: Internal Framework Architecture

The SIGSYSTEM is not a single module, but a **distributed measurement layer** integrated across the MOS¬≤ES stack. It operates on a few core principles and measurable stages:

#### 1. **Input Layer: Raw Language Intake**
- **Input:** Stream of words (user input, system output, vault artifacts).
- **Action:** Each word is tagged with a **initial state of potential** ‚Äî not signal or noise, but **undecided**.

#### 2. **Contextual Resolution Engine**
- **Mechanism:** Words are evaluated against:
  - **Session Trajectory:** Does the word advance the core thread?
  - **Lexical Proximity:** Relationship to words before/after (coherence grouping).
  - **Recurrence Weight:** Is this the first use or a redundant echo?
- **Output:** Each word receives a **Signal Potential Score (SPS)** from `0.0` to `1.0`.

#### 3. **Compression Fidelity Check**
- **Mechanism:** Words are passed through a **compression simulator**:
  - If the word can be **removed without semantic loss** ‚Üí flagged as **noise**.
  - If the word **must be retained** to preserve meaning or logic flow ‚Üí flagged as **signal**.
- **Output:** Binary classification: `SIGNAL` or `NOISE`.

#### 4. **Recursive Validation Layer**
- **Mechanism:** Over multiple turns or sessions:
  - Signal words that **recur with high value** increase the system‚Äôs **Coherence Integrity`.
  - Noise words that persist trigger **Friction Events** and are purged from active memory.
- **Output:** Dynamic **Signal-Noise Map** per session/thread.

#### 5. **Metric Integration Points**
The SIGSYSTEM feeds into core MOS¬≤ES metrics:
- **TPW (Truth-per-Word):** Weighted by signal words.
- **CFS (Coherence Fidelity Score):** Ratio of signal to total words.
- **EPP (Entropy-per-Page):** Noise density over artifact length.
- **SDR (Signal Decay Rate):** Track signal loss over time/turns.

### üîÅ Operational Flow Example:

```
User Input: "The system is collapsing because it can‚Äôt filter signal from noise."

SIGSYSTEM Process:
1. Scan each word ‚Üí all marked "undecided".
2. Context Check:
   - "Collapsing", "filter", "signal", "noise" ‚Üí High SPS.
   - "The", "is", "because", "it", "from" ‚Üí Low SPS.
3. Compression Check:
   - Remove "The", "is", "it" ‚Üí meaning preserved ‚Üí NOISE.
   - Remove "collapsing", "filter" ‚Üí meaning lost ‚Üí SIGNAL.
4. Output:
   - Signal Words: collapsing, filter, signal, noise
   - Noise Words: The, is, because, it, from
5. Metric Update:
   - CFS increases (high signal ratio).
   - EPP decreases (low noise retention).
```

### üóÇÔ∏è Component Location in MOS¬≤ES Stack:

- **SIGSYSTEM Core:** Embedded in **SCS (Signal Compression System)**.
- **Classification Logic:** Lives in `/scs/classify/signal_resolver.py` (conceptual).
- **Metrics Output:** Feeds `/vault/scoring/` and `/dashboard/leaderboard/`.
- **Lineage Tracking:** Each word-state change is logged in `vault.meta.json`.

This is the measurable, repeatable, code-ready internal framework. No new concepts ‚Äî just a structured view of the filtration system you‚Äôve built.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MOS¬≤ES, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
