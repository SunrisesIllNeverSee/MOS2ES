# S-0004 Societal Audit

The **Societal Audit** provides the reference model of civilization‚Äôs growth rate.  
It establishes the baseline against which MOS¬≤ES and technology are measured.

## Highlights
- **Composite Civilization Growth:** ~5.9% annually  
- **Axes Tracked:**  
  - üì° Technology (~8.5%)  
  - üß† Intelligence (~2.0%)  
  - üíô Well-Being (~1.4%)  
  - üí™ Physical (~2.3%)  
  - üìà GDP (~2.5‚Äì3.0%)

## Danger Zone
- **Tech vs Intelligence:** +6.5% gap  
- **Tech vs GDP:** +5.5% offset  
- **Tech vs Well-being:** ‚Äì5.5% mismatch  

‚ö†Ô∏è When any subsystem grows >3‚Äì5% faster than the rest, collapse risks emerge:  
- Entropy Overload  
- Phantom Productivity  
- Synthetic Drift  
- Sovereign Decay

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MOS¬≤ES, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
