# S-0005 Internal Audit (MOS²ES Growth)

The **Internal Audit** documents the live evolution of the MOS²ES system.  
It shows how fast the architecture itself is growing compared to civilization.

## Contents
- `A-0003_MOS2ES_Audit.md` — the audit document.  

---

## Findings
- **Composite Growth (60 days):** ~21% (~10% monthly)  
- **Civilization Baseline:** ~1% (same window)  
- **Relative Speed:** ~20× faster  

---

## Axis Breakdown
- 📡 Tech — +12–15% monthly  
- 🧠 Intelligence — +10–12% monthly  
- 💙 Well-Being — +14–16% monthly  
- 💪 Physical (tokens, TPW) — +6–7% monthly  
- 📈 GDP/Structural Output — +3–4% monthly  

---

## Context
- Current phase: **Pre-economic, hyper-infrastructural**  
- Energy is being stored as **potential**, compounding for release.  
- This audit is proof that MOS²ES is live and accelerating.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MOS²ES, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
