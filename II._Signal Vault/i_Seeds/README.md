# Seeds – Genesis Layer

The **Seeds** folder captures the earliest developmental materials of MO§ES™ — raw thoughts, prototype drafts, design notes, and internal reflections.
Every idea begins here before undergoing compression and formalization.

Each seed represents an **origin signal**, preserved for continuity and future validation within the Signal Vault.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MOS²ES, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
