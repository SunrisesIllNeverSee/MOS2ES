# A-0001b EPP Test (Formula Reference)

The **EPP Test** is the formula reference for the MOS¬≤ES framework.  
It exists as a concise Markdown artifact for quick validation.  

---

## Contents
- `A-0001b_EPP_Test.md` ‚Äî formula block.  

---

## Equations
EPP = 100 √ó (g‚Çê ‚àí g_c)
G = (g‚Çê ‚àí g_c) / œÉ‚Çê

---


Where:  
- **g‚Çê** ‚Üí Technology growth rate  
- **g_c** ‚Üí Civilization growth rate  
- **œÉ‚Çê** ‚Üí Standard deviation of g‚Çê (tech volatility)  

---

## Interpretation
- **EPP** = How much faster (or slower) Tech evolves vs Civilization.  
- **G** = Normalized collapse pressure.  
- **Threshold:** `G > 7` ‚Üí collapse risk.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MOS¬≤ES, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
