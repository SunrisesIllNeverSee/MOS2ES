# MO§ES™ Protocol Network

**MO§ES™ (Modular Operating §ignal Scaling Expansion System)** is a sovereign signal governance protocol designed to confront **Exponential Bloat**, **Entropy Drift**, and the collapse of fidelity across digital and ecological systems.

Unlike conventional software, MO§ES™ functions as a **Protocol State**: a self-governing architecture where **constitutional laws, legal protections, and recursive physics** enforce signal integrity across time.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into four primary sections:

### I. **MO§ES™ – Roots & IP**

The foundation of the protocol.

* Trademark filing receipt (IC 042: SaaS Signal Governance).
* Provisional patent application abstracts (MOS²ES + SCS Engine).
* Core philosophy: **Compression Precedes Ignition**, **Lineage Resilience**, and **The Blackhole Law**.
* Secures the **legal perimeter** and establishes MO§ES™ as a constitutional architecture.

📎 See [`I. MO§ES™/`](./I.%20MO§ES™)

### II. **Signal Vault – Core Archive**

The protected archive of the system.

* **Seeds**: `_seed_vault_journal.md` captures developmental history.
* **Artifacts**: Cryptographically hashed PDFs (PPAs, SR³ Spec, Core Docs).
* Integrity ensured via SHA-256 checksums.

📎 See [`II. Signal_Vault/`](./II.%20Signal_Vault)
