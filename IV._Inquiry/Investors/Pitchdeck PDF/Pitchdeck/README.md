# MO§ES™ — Artifact Deck A-0000: Tech Silos vs Rings

> 🧠 **Pro Tip:** You can copy any section of this repo and paste it into ChatGPT or another AI assistant to help decode, explain, or teach it back to you. Try it on equations, glossary terms, or architecture diagrams.

This repository contains the MOS²ES pitch deck framing the **Four Towers of Big Tech**  
(Model Scale, Provenance, Evaluation, Deployment) and the **Four Rings of MOS²ES**  
(Compression, Lineage, Metrics, Governance).

## Purpose
This artifact demonstrates how **MOS²ES provides the connective architecture** missing from  
Big Tech silos. It is not a business plan — it is a **public artifact for verification**.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MO§ES™, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
