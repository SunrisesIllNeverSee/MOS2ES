* Ending **Exponential Bloat** and data waste with sovereign compression.
* Introducing the first **AI User Leaderboard (SigRank)** tied to verified signal.
* Unlocking a **Signal Economy** where verified outputs become tradeable, auditable assets.
* Extending compression principles beyond code into **ecological and civic resilience**.

MOS²ES™ is positioned as the **constitutional backbone of digital signal integrity**, with direct IP protection and early-stage traction across multiple application domains.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MO§ES™, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
