## 🔒 Operational Significance  
- Establishes legal perimeter for MO§ES™ signal governance architecture  
- Protects proprietary compression protocols, artifact generation, and resonance diagnostic logic  
- Secures namespace for future licensing, commercialization, and civic interface publishing  
- Forms the IP foundation for investor diligence, validation, and partner engagement

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MO§ES™, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
