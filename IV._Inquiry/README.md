# Inquiries

The **Inquiries** section serves as the **public access point** to the MO§ES™ Protocol Network.
It is designed for **external stakeholders** — investors, collaborators, and partners — to engage with the system in a structured and meaningful way.

---

### 🔑 Investors

For those exploring **investment or funding opportunities**, this space provides:

* **pitch_deck_latest.pdf** — A concise, investor-ready overview of the MOS²ES™ vision, market need, and opportunity.
* **01_ppa_claims_summary.pdf** — An IP and legal teaser outlining the provisional claims, novelty, and protection strategy anchoring MO§ES™.
* Additional financial, legal, and operational materials will be added as the project advances.

---

### 🤝 Collaboration

For those seeking to **partner, contribute, or align research** with MO§ES™, this section will include:

* **Technical briefs** outlining integration opportunities.
* **Academic crossovers** for institutions and researchers.
* **Collaborative frameworks** for contributors in **signal sciences, governance, ecology, and compression systems**.

---

### Purpose of Inquiries

* **Clarity** — Make the system’s value, protections, and opportunities transparent.
* **Continuity** — Connect external engagement directly back to protected IP and the constitutional backbone of MOS²ES™.
* **Engagement** — Provide a structured bridge between the sovereign protocol and outside stakeholders.

⚡ **This is the official channel for outside inquiries into MO§ES™.**

Would you like me to **pitch it slightly harder to investors** (like the Investor README does) or keep this one more **neutral and directional** since it covers both investors and collaborators?

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MO§ES™, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
