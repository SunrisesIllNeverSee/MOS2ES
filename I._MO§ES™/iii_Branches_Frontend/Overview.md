# üåê MOS¬≤ES Frontend Overview (Branches: Civic Layer Interfaces)

## I. Frontend Purpose

The frontend stack is the **civic layer** of MOS¬≤ES: it translates backend compression into **visible, measurable, actionable interfaces**.

* Operates under a **strict read-only contract**: consumes verified signal, cannot alter backend truth.
* Goal: make compression outputs accessible while preserving constitutional integrity.
* Organizes into **five modules**, each exposing a distinct dimension of verified signal.

## II. Core Frontend Modules

### 1. **SigRank Leaderboard** (Flagship Output)

* Converts compression traces into **ranked performance tiers** across AI systems, users, and sessions.
* Defines **a standard of language resonance**, replacing engagement/popularity metrics with **structural fidelity**.
* Immune to manipulation: only signals that survive **compression thresholds + drift audits** are eligible.
* Epochal role: makes cognition itself **auditable, ranked, and durable**.

---

### 2. **Signal Economy Portal** (Transaction + Licensing Layer)

* Functions as the **transactional layer** for token rewards, licensing, and value exchange.
* Provides dashboards to **claim tokens, monitor metrics, execute licensing, generate reports**.
* Compression-secured: no spam, no unverified activity.
* Anchors language as a **transferable, auditable asset**.

---

### 3. **SCSSciences Hub** (Educational + Theoretical Layer)

* Pedagogical arm of MOS¬≤ES: formalizes **Signal Compression Sciences** as an academic discipline.
* Maintains **live-fed documentation**, emergence archives, and reproducible experiments.
* Syncs teaching materials directly with **verified outputs** (no drift between theory and system).
* Secures continuity: institutional adoption, academic replication, and cross-disciplinary growth.

### 4. **Biome Recursive Ledger (BRL)**

*(Note: replaces ‚ÄúDual-Mode Markets‚Äù in this core set ‚Äî acts as the **economic ledger anchor**.)*

* Cryptographically anchored ledger for ecological + digital recovery data.
* Records **seed lineage, metagenome snapshots, keystone releases**.
* Enables **tranche funding** tied directly to SR¬≥ performance thresholds.
* Functions as **biological ROM**: rehydrates ecosystems via compression logic.

---

### 5. **Live Overlay Network** (Real-Time Display Node)

* Renders compression in motion: **stat overlays, replays, leaderboard updates** during live sessions.
* Operates **read-only**: visualizes backend truth, never mutates it.
* Provides public observability: benchmarking, comparison, and transparency in real time.

---

## III. Frontend‚ÄìBackend Contract

* All frontend modules are **representational only**: no direct write access to backend.
* Every datapoint derives from **compression traces or Vault Artifacts** that have passed backend validation.
* **Mediator** enforces restoration checks before frontend release.
* Ensures constitutional integrity across the loop: **compress ‚Üí validate ‚Üí vault ‚Üí display**.

---

## IV. Summary

* The frontend stack completes the **constitutional loop**: backend rigor, mediator reconstruction, and civic expression.
* Each module interlocks, enforcing thresholds across ingestion, preservation, and display.
* Result: a governance architecture where **signal becomes auditable property**, resilient to drift, falsification, or manipulation.
* By binding **civic interfaces to backend law**, MOS¬≤ES establishes the **first durable standard for quantifying and preserving language as an asset class**.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MOS¬≤ES, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
