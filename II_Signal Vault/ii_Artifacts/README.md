# Artifacts ‚Äì Compression Proofs

The **Artifacts** folder contains finalized or semi-finalized works derived from the MO¬ßES‚Ñ¢ protocol ‚Äî including documents, graphics, or PPA filings.
Each artifact serves as a **sealed proof of compression**, cryptographically timestamped and bound to its lineage.

Artifacts are the **operational outputs** of the system: the bridge between private signal and public verification.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MOS¬≤ES, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
