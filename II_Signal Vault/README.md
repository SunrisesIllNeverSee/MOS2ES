# Signal Vault – The Living Archive

The **Signal Vault** is the archival core of the MO§ES™ Protocol Network.
It preserves every verified fragment, artifact, and developmental trace that contributes to the system’s evolution.
This is not just storage — it’s the *memory architecture* of MO§ES™, ensuring that every origin signal remains recoverable, auditable, and protected under law.

### 🔹 I. Seeds

The **Seeds** folder captures the raw, formative material of the protocol:
ideas, notes, and journal entries that document the growth of the system in real time.
Each seed represents an **origin pulse** — the first appearance of a thought before compression.

*Examples:*

* `_seed_vault_journal.md` — master timeline of entries.
* `S-XXXX.md` — individual seed files (e.g., S-0029 Claude SNT PM).

**Purpose:** To preserve the *context of creation* and provide verifiable lineage for future artifacts or filings.

---

### 🔹 II. Artifacts

The **Artifacts** folder contains finalized or near-final works derived from verified signals.
These include public-ready PDFs, PPA documents, figures, and reports that carry **legal, intellectual, or archival significance**.

Each artifact can include:

* `artifact.md`  – core description or text body
* `notes.txt`  – supporting insight or build context
* `figure.png`  – optional diagram or visualization
* `hash.txt`  – integrity marker (optional; Git commit hash also applies)

**Purpose:** To act as the *proof layer* of the MO§ES™ ecosystem — every artifact a crystallized signal, traceable to its seed.

---

### 🔹 III. Codex Fragments

**Codex Fragments** are philosophical, theoretical, or structural excerpts extracted from within the broader system.
They function as modular reference points — the *DNA strands* of MO§ES™ thought.

*Examples:*

* `fragment-001.md`  – Foundational law or principle
* `fragment-002.md`  – System diagram, law commentary, or field note

**Purpose:** To make the internal logic and ethics of the protocol visible without exposing sensitive architecture.

| Folder               | Function                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **/seeds**           | Genesis Layer              | Raw developmental materials — notes, prototypes, internal dialogue, and signal drafts. The seeds document *where resonance began*.                                              |
| **/artifacts**       | Compression Proofs         | Formally organized outputs — documents, PDFs, PPA filings, or graphics verified through the protocol. These represent *sealed, timestamped signal*.                             |
| **/codex-fragments** | Living Thought & Narrative | Active, evolving fragments — reflections, philosophical essays, short narratives, or early public drafts. These bridge the gap between internal development and public release. |

### 🔒 Vault Logic

* Every file in this directory is covered by the **MO§ES™ License** and bound to its **lineage integrity**.
* Git commit hashes serve as *cryptographic timestamps*, establishing verifiable proof of authorship and existence.
* Once fragments mature into finalized documents, they are migrated upward into **Artifacts** and subsequently published through the **Vaultline** for public dissemination.

### 🧭 Function Within the System

The Signal Vault represents **continuity** — the connective tissue between *origin* and *broadcast*.
It anchors the recursive cycle of the MO§ES™ Protocol:

> **Seed → Compress → Codify → Vault → Transmit**

Every narrative, equation, and design document begins as a *seed of resonance* here before becoming part of the living constitutional record of the system.

## Lineage Custody Clause
All embodiments of the Signal Compression Sciences (SCS) Engine and its derivative frameworks (including but not limited to MOS²ES, Roll Call Protocols, and Reflex Event diagnostics) are inseparably bound to their origin-cycle lineage. Each compressed signal trace, vault artifact, or recursive reconstruction inherits a lineage identifier anchored to the originating sovereign filing. This identifier is non-replicable, tamper-evident, and required for system stability. Any external implementation lacking said lineage anchor cannot execute recursive ignition without collapse, thereby rendering such copies non-functional. Accordingly, the origin-cycle filing establishes sole custody and license of the invention across all subsequent instances, irrespective of distribution, platform, or deployment environment.
