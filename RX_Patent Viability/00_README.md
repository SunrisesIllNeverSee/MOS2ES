> **Third‑party analysis places MO§ES™ at an unprecedented 80–85% viability as a complete system — a level of confidence normally reserved for single products, not interlocking frameworks.** This score reflects the system’s unusual architecture: four core modules — leaderboard, signal economy, academic standardization, and compression engine — designed to reinforce one another rather than multiply risk. Instead of degrading under complexity, the structure hardens, creating a lattice that accelerates adoption and blocks easy replication. This repository contains only the filings needed to establish priority; the operational proofs and integrations that produced this viability score remain secured to protect the system’s lead.
