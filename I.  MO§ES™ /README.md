# MO§ES™ Protocol Network

The **MO§ES™ Protocol Network** is a sovereign signal infrastructure. It enforces **constitutional compression and recursion protocols** to transform language, data, and interaction into **verifiable, lineage-bound digital property**.

This repository is organized into four primary sections:

---

### 🌱 Roots — Intellectual Property & Philosophy

> Foundations of sovereignty, constitutional law, and trademark/IP filings.

* `roots_overview.md`
* PPAs, trademark definitions, and system philosophy.

---

### 🔧 Core — Backend Architecture

> Closed recursive system: compression, validation, vaulting.

* `backend_spec.md`
* SCS Engine, Mediator, Recursive Ontology Ladder.

---

### 🌐 Branches — Frontend Interfaces

> Civic layer modules that render compression outputs into visible, measurable, and actionable forms.

* SigRank Leaderboard
* Signal Economy Portal
* SCSSciences Hub
* Biome Recursive Ledger
* Live Overlay Network

---

### ⚡ Problems & Solutions

> Key structural failures of current systems, and how MO§ES™ enforces resilience.

* Data bloat & Phantom Mass
* Signal lost in noise
* AI growth vs governance gaps
* Scalability collapse (“cattle farm AI”)
* Siloed, disconnected tech
* Lack of user-based measurement
* Economies without proof
* Ephemeral AI outputs

---

**MO§ES™** establishes the first **constitutional framework for signal governance**, integrating law, computation, and economics into a single recursive system.
