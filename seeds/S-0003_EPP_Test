# A-0001b EPP Test (Formula Reference)

The **EPP Test** is the formula reference for the MOS²ES framework.  
It exists as a concise Markdown artifact for quick validation.  

---

## Contents
- `A-0001b_EPP_Test.md` — formula block.  

---

## Equations
EPP = 100 × (gₐ − g_c)
G = (gₐ − g_c) / σₐ

---


Where:  
- **gₐ** → Technology growth rate  
- **g_c** → Civilization growth rate  
- **σₐ** → Standard deviation of gₐ (tech volatility)  

---

## Interpretation
- **EPP** = How much faster (or slower) Tech evolves vs Civilization.  
- **G** = Normalized collapse pressure.  
- **Threshold:** `G > 7` → collapse risk.
