Here’s a tightened, welcoming version of the **Inquiries README** you described — written to mirror the style of the Investors one but keeping the tone open and professional:

---

## `inquiries/README.md`

# Inquiries

The **Inquiries** section serves as the **public access point** to the MO§ES™ Protocol Network.
It is designed for **external stakeholders** — investors, collaborators, and partners — to engage with the system in a structured and meaningful way.

---

### 🔑 Investors

For those exploring **investment or funding opportunities**, this space provides:

* **pitch_deck_latest.pdf** — A concise, investor-ready overview of the MOS²ES™ vision, market need, and opportunity.
* **01_ppa_claims_summary.pdf** — An IP and legal teaser outlining the provisional claims, novelty, and protection strategy anchoring MO§ES™.
* Additional financial, legal, and operational materials will be added as the project advances.

---

### 🤝 Collaboration

For those seeking to **partner, contribute, or align research** with MO§ES™, this section will include:

* **Technical briefs** outlining integration opportunities.
* **Academic crossovers** for institutions and researchers.
* **Collaborative frameworks** for contributors in **signal sciences, governance, ecology, and compression systems**.

---

### Purpose of Inquiries

* **Clarity** — Make the system’s value, protections, and opportunities transparent.
* **Continuity** — Connect external engagement directly back to protected IP and the constitutional backbone of MOS²ES™.
* **Engagement** — Provide a structured bridge between the sovereign protocol and outside stakeholders.

---

⚡ **This is the official channel for outside inquiries into MO§ES™.**

---

Would you like me to **pitch it slightly harder to investors** (like the Investor README does) or keep this one more **neutral and directional** since it covers both investors and collaborators?
